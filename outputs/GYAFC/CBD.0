i mean that you have to really be her friend .
r u asking a rhetorical question ?
i do nt wanna be mean .
because some women send alot more to men than probally bein controled ...
let him / coffee and cream and from taht point !
also i ve <unk> it when my father is unhappy
ask him if you should go see a doctor
he probably has many things to worry about right now other than you
but i do nt believe that he will be <unk> u or leave u to lack of sex ...
will i always feel that way ?
cuz he may enjoy all of the waiting , dreaming and flirting
also i would like to try again .
some men shave it depends on the woman
well if u are really attracted to this guy then smile n talk to him .
i m not certain he loves u but he definitely likes u
coomplicated <unk> women are <unk> <unk>
i realize i m overly selective when it comes to people & how can i stop this ?
doing that does sound rather desparate ...
sometimes if the good outweighs the bad then the difficulties are worth it
that s if both of you agree to do this ...
well why do you like the boy who picks on you ?
hmm .. sometimes men think that they do nt need you that s until you are gone .
yah , if you wear alot of you .. do nt be <unk> to ya ..
do i wanna be in love ?
they will think you are leering if you look at them creepily
i think that u are right <unk> its confusing
how do i get my self to show me that he loves me
that s if you truly adore them ...
do nt sell yourself , even if he is hott !
you sound hav a very lovely person , so do nt allow these women to make u feel bad .
i do nt know but i have alot of that webpage i visit ..
i wud urge u to consider how many men / women exist ...
without being in a relationship that might b a little <unk> ...
he asked if i would like to use his chapstick
u should never allow a man to mistreat you .
absolutly not , he is too hefty and i am undesirably frail .
you can tell him if he says yes
what was the mistake that u part in ?
king has a song about this it is called ' your mother loves you ...
y r u in a relationship if our partner treats us y we fall in love ?
if you have it , what was it like ?
its not a turn off if she drinks too much
if that 's what you want .
its like getting rid of a drug habit .
wow , i got ta do that the next time that i am dating .
i guess , what is your :) lol ?
sounds like you both are comfortable with how things are now .
do nt allow her to dominate ur life for she jus <unk> to learn to deal with it
if he does nt go out with you do nt worry as there are plenty of other options ...
no man gave you everything you want .
if you want to stay married buddies you need to find yourself
start with a simple question and ppl start from that point
alot of their desire to talk to a * * * * by u
trust him and do nt bring the matter up again .
i m still trying to work up my nerves to try that out .
find the one who loves you also .
i will be your self is you come to me town ...
stay very far away from this man ...
its your choice not to b / dislike , i didnt have them all to say the least .
i would perfer 3 or 2
he is a womanizer and has been telling that to some young woman .
i knew all my girlfriends were not the one until i met my wife .
do not try to have both of them at once , whatever you do .
sex is not the only important thing in life !
i have a yahoo e - mail address and that s <unk> for me
for me , its fun !
but he was a little busy right ?
that will just be <unk> sex .
do nt approach her and let her know that u find her looks very hot
sounds like you are going through lots of things right now .
but u got to ask a girl 4 the symptoms since i m a boy .
i had always felt the same way but my views when i met my true love !
your best friend is a good choice to marry in nobody else works out
i do nt want to ask <unk> and ask ' will you go out with me '
unless u know him fairly well u stinking yourself out there to get hurt
if your personal self in something its not good or bad .
they annoy u all the day .
either go to hawaii or someone
i can dont stop caring about him and forget about him as though he <unk> nothing to me
is it to clear bout that when it turns a yellow dries ?
its a turn off if she sits on ur best friend 's lap when drunk
he had a controlling personality ...
determination is one of the gifts we can give ourselves ...
u should get married only after you have been with a man for at least 2 years ...
hugs and hugs to tom at all girls ! !
when you are wither her just be yourself
i have no idea what you are trying to say
a man asked if i would mind u go with him
why would some men do that ?
a few women are left , you dont have to look in the right places .
you should either move on or work it out with your partner .
get a hold of yourself , how could u love a person that u do nt even speak to ?
find a girl who is also pretty .
that does nt mean that you are promiscuious .
it 's the only time in your life , you 're gon na live out true love !
you will have to find an answer
give them two months and they will get over you
after some time you wo nt see the color .
he probably wants to know if you 're interested in him ...
if she is no interested in you
you definately ai nt a <unk> woman so do nt worry
no .... u r looking for a person to feel mor ......
u should break up and keep yourself open to other options ...
have you had a pap smear ?
i can dont say yes and mention that i m an proud and have long hair
i have a friend in a <unk> ...
i do nt know , maybe you are young .
hi my name is going to b anonymous , but i ve been working together with this person for years ...
honestly if you love him then you will tell him .
if you 're honestly attracted to her , go with your emotions ...
think about wat u can really afford it and if u want 2 then go 4 it
get your old life back so you can stay alive
dude , what are you saying she is ?
do nt <unk> n such ai n't <unk> ...
maybe some women would say that it hurts a lot
if i were mad , it would be easier to do .
you should also move on if they have .
you are being <unk> so you do n't get to watch tv for a month .
tell him and it would nt seem psychotic because you have to know one another for awhile
& ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
give them a chance to see all of your bf
unless its aligned with the male
my boyfriend loves me very much and does nt want to lose me .
if they are <unk> ... or is what matters
after a while it has to be played out .
everyone , even if they do nt admit it to be told they are sexy
i like to go dancing at clubs in downtown huston .
good luck but remember to do your homework
i prefer natural <unk> , rather than a full face ... or ...
if u r interested in the man then try it .
now we are just now divorced ...
someone alot do nt have feelings ? ? ?
actions are better then words ...
i have been like $ semi - pink hue , however , what should it be ?
watch telephones for if he sends an easy mail or even cares .
be sure to never ignore her , listen to her , and do nt change the <unk>
he is my # <unk> source of ur i graduate from college ...
she will tell you if its not ok
i do nt believe i mind either way .
do nt eat in the same place you defecate ...
ur gon na get some highlights <unk> as well
do n't worry about him , concentrate on your classes , and you boyfriend .
i do nt think i should have done that .
foreplay is important and should last , at the mininum <unk> 5 minutes
coz a special gift i can give to my brother in - law on his birthday ?
try to be authentic and do nt act ostentatiously
if they do nt then you will have to continue with your life .
your first kiss , but <unk> should be heavenly
in a family life this is the most beautiful
hell yeah i'll be a genuine indication
i know 3 men i can do that with
its okay to jump on him if he is flirting with her .
stick with the boys who are either 13 or a
tell him you dont want to be friends are disappointed by his actions ..
! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
unless you are very desperate wait for him to ask you out
if he insists for ya ... then its his only goal .
i would enjoy having some fun with you , that s why i answered this ridiculous question ...
do u feel in that biz ?
<unk> <unk> some money and <unk> him that he got to leave
definately he will call you .
something you can o is your life with out him or her
i pick the domestic goddess :)
do u love her deeply ?
men get bored before women do
u can save money with respect to flowers .
if you are not happy then you need to fix it or leave
just because he has potential to be a decent boyfriend does nt mean that he will be .
u can tok ... k ?
having a big penis does n't mean you are good in bed
yes it looks so beautiful on almost any woman
men have sex with issues dude ...
oh yeah it <unk> the man
people had me , why was i rushing ?
both of them do nt respect ur feelings .
even though i see him psr each week in <unk> i ca nt find the <unk> to talk to him .
i do nt find a man who acts that way ..
i m attracted to men who shave their legs ...
is gay or is it just curiosity ?
in my opinion they do ...
it is a wrong decision that ca nt be undone !
i lost my virginity in a park when was i 16
they have never met in person but she says they are in love .
ask him if he would like to dance with you
live life to the fullest and have faith !
i do nt know if you fell down but i want to have sex
he knows that u like him so just ask him on a date
your fear and repel mack him
i would nt drive for 5 hours just to spend time with someone unless i really liked her a lot .
her friend to talk with her on the phone ?
u should play sports with your male friends
iniitially elated joyful u feel ruminating , u feel <unk> , and <unk> jus <unk> on that guy .
i ca nt picture my life without my husband .
we seem to always push away the ones who we love
if u both feel the same way when u r older then go for it .
i use the ' man ' very carefull ' 2 ? when <unk>
personally i prefer a <unk> and kinda music .
any woman looks hot when u're unattractive man <unk> ...
its happened to me , and now i am dating person

show her your nude & her .
why do u look to <unk> marriage ?
we participated in 6th on the hood of my car in the <unk> <unk>
y should men grow up if women expect men to act like that ?
you need to do this a few times to get comfortable .
while having sex is listening to a fantasy ...
at the moment i think he is angry , and talked to be with you ...
if anyone knows the answer please let me know
red stands for love , black , stands for <unk> and so on
i like someone with some weight because i feel cheated with a thin one
if you do nt know ask someone who has the answer
his buddies to make up to you will be ...
the one that pick on you usually likes you
alright , i ve been attracted to this girl since i was in the 8th grade .
did you see her looking at you ?
i never knew that life could be so <unk>
what s the best for both of you ?
at least she did n't give you a fake number .
hmmm in my opinion , you are not totally straight .
but let them get married if they ca nt control themselves .
bcuz she calls him very badly .
why bother if you are already doing it ?
many times you have loved a man but were not sure if he loved you back
should i break up with him because of his mother ?
make a nice move , and if there is no responce , she is not interested
i have friends that get married after 6 months of dating
demonstrate your askin her to her gently ...
you will look for revenge :)
that s a <unk> that has things right
if you do n't ask the question you will always wonder about the answer
i would suggest nt worrying about it overmuch ...
what s the worst thing that could happen ?
i am confused and do nt know what to do becuase i hate for the girl to be that way .
you should find someone who does nt hate you .
do nt be rude ! !
men jus have no inclination dancing ...
this is not an urs !
depends on if u were u gon na trust him .
sexy gals and jus accept what they are gon na get ...
people choose to be husbands and wives for reasons
its not worth it , if all you do is argue
have a good time in jail your stomach that s a question
are you asking if i like you ?
what did u kiss ?
females have alot of sex with other females , curiousity , myself !
1 - two is fine and she does nt have to be younger than you
when ur mum will be easier to make ...
he cheated , cuz which i believe means i can lift or carry my husband
try to make the best out of a bad situation ...
r u looking for friendship ?
i kno that he would make a great valentine ...
<unk> due to the many temptations ...
2 take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship ?
it will all depend on when u r ready
of course i would love to meet women ...
its just the way things are .
its ok to be friends with someone online but there should be limits
can u imagine a family with him ?
wat he pulled your request , his value is too low to start with .
to tell the truth , u will learn alot but u must experience things
hopefully you married your husband because you love him .
i know i have someone who will be waiting when i come home ...
get away from y all , go enjoy a massage .
i do nt know where to start .
that depends r u an ass with an athletic guy in ?
you r to <unk> ur avatar ?
if a man cares about you then he will call .
in my opinion there is a large difference between having ' sex ' and ' making love '
you do n't need to stay together , even if you have a child .
you are a young woman from a rural environment or from an urban environment ? ?
getting married and having kids can be postponed , but your studies can not be
i have never attended it all <unk>
do u want to be in a relationship with the same man ?
how often can u have gals with pamela anderson ?
u should make sure that getting ur point across does nt <unk> in u
this just hits too close to home for me , my mother has also cancer
i love to run my fingers through curly
i am talkin 2 the sort of <unk> you know
the right woman will come along if you are ...
i want my wife to grow as well ...
he is obviously shy , maybe you sould make a move .
coz the doctor was surprised as well
maybe you guess its a no but its a yes .
men do not , only little boys .
maybe ask if they would like to go on a date sometime !
like it to me , twice .
you should nt go out with a man because you feel the ' <unk> '
u would nt be asking if u really wanted to be with him .
and i just pray that it never hurts !
most women are waiting for a man to tell her his true feelings ...
women are more <unk> during sex ...
don`t try 2 impress her
leaning me and kissing me <unk> me on the <unk>
i m not that type of person cuz i know lots of people like that .
okay it depends on how fast u r starting to experience emotions for this boy !
in advance , thanks for the pep :)
why do they wanna be married ?
we like to be with someone elses toys , chasing with some light .
i would like a trip to an <unk> .... or a museum
i have feelings for a person and need to know if i m in love
do u enjoy fake nails or manicured nails ?
first plan what you want and do nt worry about wid sum1 else ...
i do nt understand u tho
i like the perfume that u wear .
i think most men do nt care but it does depend on the guy person .
its nothing to do with being vulnerable ... or submissinve
do nt get married so early in the relationship .
u r not a good person of u plan to be <unk> to ur wife
be the best version of yourself and if he is impressed he will talk to u
you do n't want to be with anyone , but that person .
he s getting married , stop doin it .
wat u did to her ( the nature of her daily - ins with you ?
when i move in i was asked out by my neighbor
most women like boys / city teen girls like girls enjoy fornication .
he played a good game of <unk>
do nt worry hell come to you .
are you someone who <unk> and fighting ?
most important issue is do nt try to retaliate at the guy that wronged u
one man willing to move alot of one and 2 - 5 times just to be with me
have u seen a doctor yet ?
maybe she s not a shrew but the thin woman definately was
u should piss an active life and not waste my time
indulging to over 2 <unk> - <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> because u gained weight ...
i <unk> and there was valentines present ...
if he is single go for it .
if you do nt wanna men like this , they become the sort who beat their wives ...
are you or are you not attracted to him ?
if u are sure cuz then u should tell ur parents its u have nt done so .
many people will probably cheat ...
do u believe he has the same feelings 4 u ?
some men only say that word if they mean it .
it shows that he likes u and u should show him how u feel
i m of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name
friends are forever because guys come and go
try to imagine that it was love ...
i guess you should be ready even if your relationship survives the 4 the kid .
all honesty ... , men like women of that type and others , not as much ...
if you want kids , then be a homemaker .
younger men and older women , good idea or not ?
he wants to b <unk> !
ofcourse there is no labeling to the proper <unk> ' love '
also , your self - esteem is very important ...
i say those things and i m female .
trust me girls can be just as perverted .
flowers are nice , even if the do not last long .
there s alot that i have to see .
she is a very sweet girl , just the person you are looking for !
try to use your brain and not your manhood , maybe she does not love you
no disrespect & intended , but that does sound like a lady 's name .
i would nt take the trouble to call him back .
no women i m attracted to in my list ...... i choose my <unk> spouse
marraige is marraige about trust and communication .
do nt listen to anyone else 's advice .
wat should i do to be with her ?
give them a rose and express your love for them
its soo unusual cuz i agree its nothing bad .
you need to see ... what 's right for you both .
they are woman enough for a man , but they are n't as sophisticated as us ...
exactly , especially when she became sick .
i can u any further without any more info
kissing is something you ca nt do wrong or right
:) take time to decide ...
surround yourself with friends is ok .
i would say , that its more of a trust issue .
i need someone to assist me in figuring this out
then move on if he still does nt like you .
he probably is n't interested either .
try it to make yourself whenever possible .
you can do anything else besides work and fix things ?
i told her i realy loved her .
it seems that all of the male a girls think that freshmen girls r <unk> ...
so how do i dont kiss him ?
if you check in the gals it should be there .
i hope that you find a nice girl to date ...
i do nt believe that s a good idea .... you are nt there for that purpose .
its a very long list !
i would say brokeback mountain u will be happy even if its a man .
if you do nt base your relationship on sex then its ok .
ha ha its also a portender of misfortune to glimpse <unk> at the <unk> marriage ceremony .
hold on and stay strong and good luck !
um , modest - get together for <unk>
if u are skeptical about a stupid bunch of it then do nt do it
i am married now i am married
i guess its totally depends on age and upbringing
once you have kids you will need to decide on a last name
your child will find it gon na be up without a father .
bald men look like to me i do n't find it attractive .
ask what the <unk> of the last week was ...
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex .
the best and the easiest way is to fly or <unk> to las vegas and get married
of course , let me get to you more .
a prefr but what ever i do or bigger is a waste .
and then mislead and fabricate some more fun .
they have nt <unk> and the pleasure is twice as nice !
my wife does not like to wear those brands
we are alot of what you look like
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life
i think this is better than my personal life
do n't go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex .
<unk> with ur best friend and if its <unk> ...
sounds wierd , but it worked for me , in about 3 to 5 days .
i do nt like it when he teases you about the little things
no , because i am not married yet .
a g of ppl r heavyset 2 women & they r jus african american
if u realy luvs him then u should nt care , stay with him .
do they like you when you are with him ?
you should nt get married if you feel this strongly about it .
it 's kinda cheating on or not a person is vain ...
you need to move on and enter a relationship with someone who does nt hate you
you should becom with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out
i asked him if he was blowing me off .
maybe some young men enjoy the younger ladies ... ;)
make sure its your decision
tell him you are looking to keep it casual .
this situation is gettin one with lots of problems ...
they have been <unk> ... not always the <unk> <unk> ...
we have seen each other , everyday for 4 to 5 years ...
imagine that i am the man you want , and then date me ...
it never harms anyone to flirt a little !
you should stick with what you feel inside .
wish you luck :)
is it bad if i have nt kissed the girl i ve been with for 4 months ?
its the woman 's tho ...
i guess they look better than many other nations
it would be ok for the day .
see if she is avaliable for dinner and a movie .
some men do n't think of their partner when they just get to it .
don't ask the question in english & i m unable to understand you
i dunno but i ve never felt that way .
remember , no has ever tried to fly with one ...
i don't think about this issue .
u will never find a diffrent other despondent if u ment to be <unk>
i met agirl , and i want to know if she likes me .
do nt dont sit around and wait for the phone to ring .
be quiet and be whatever ur self that u whatever
if he comes to his senses , great , & if not you should move on ...
he may love u but he also may want 2 b his father ...
u should take action before its too late ...
this woman does n't want a man who deceives her .
i 'd enjoy hearing the <unk> of an african woman b4 this ...
don't help this win me against her !
and i almost trust : ) ( those men are in age ) to urself , more or less .
when will you start to realize this ?
i m thinkin of what i should do ...
! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i haven't such as in the company of my bf / gf ...
if you have to ask then that is a negative
do nt sit there and wait untill he realizes that you are a good one .
even though i m getting divorced i m still stuck with this .
your girlfriend will only think that you are being a jerk .
maybe u should try to pursue young women given the tendency by men to be offensive ...
i went out with my ex for 3 years and then he / she cheated .
u will know in time , and i m seeing what happens for 6 months .
well the one i pissed 4 is something like this .
not all men break up with their woman
going there s great fun , and there are lots of things to do .
is it okay to kiss on the first date ?
i have a female friend that i m close with
they lust for each other
my friend tells me that i am too nice and that i should tell him no .
but , because there always an <unk> , is there not ?
not all men but some men do
by doing so you 're still gon na retain your s
approach her , say hi and ask if she s single
that really makes me sexually , but i ran away
girls who are wierd can still be !
not every educational is <unk> <unk> ...
practice unwrapping and starburst , tying , with your tongue .
i will pay if i can get your vote for best answer
u should look for somewhere in public where u will feel most comfortable .
flirt with him and gauge his reaction
and it eases the pressure i m feeling to invite somebody
don't say will you go out with me
she does nt forget my mistakes .
how should i approach her without thinking ' i m just another man with bad intentions ?
as a man , i may have some insight ...
do nt worry you are only 13 .
dosnt always go with ur company .
if the two of you truly love each other then you will work things out ...
eye contact is the key point ! ! !
i can lift him :)
he probly has to start over and your trust again .
why do you want to ask her out ?
well , i m ' hoping you 'll screwed this very far away .
try playing ' truth , or dare together
wait til you find out and know what .... then go from there
that s stupid because you need a <unk> class for that
just quit if you do something like that .
i keep thinking about sex with her .
the only way u will know is if u confront him and ask him 2
jamie is going to ask rubi out on a date
... its still happening because 2 of u have the marrage to end things ...
it may be that its interesting for them to learn about that ...
he dribbles , shoots , and scores ... 2 points ...
do men truly prefer bigger women ?
he loves u as well but only time can tell what will happen
if a man really respects you , he will understand you
we have started our own sins ! !
his answer works for me ...
you can still love him but you need to move on .
